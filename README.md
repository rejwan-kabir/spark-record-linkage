# TL;DR

~~~bash
./run.sh <input-directory> <output-directory>
~~~

For instance, running
~~~bash
./run.sh input output
~~~

will delete any existing `output` directory, take `input` as input and write output json inside `output` directory.


Please make sure you have enough permission for specified directories.
